# Paper Prefix
## A simple and flexible prefix plugin designed for your PaperMC server.

Give your players the ability to stand out and personalize their identity! **Paper Prefix** is a lightweight and user-friendly plugin that allows players to set their own custom prefixes, which will appear in chat, the player list, and above their nametags.

## Features

* Easy for Players: Players can set their own prefix and color with a simple command: ``/prefix set <text> [color]``.
* Rich Color Support: Supports all standard Minecraft colors, plus unique Bedrock colors like ``netherite``, ``emerald``, ``amethyst``, and ``minecoin_gold``.
* Seamless Integration: Prefixes are automatically displayed in three key places:
  * In-game chat
  * The player list (tab menu)
  * Above player nametags
* Persistent: Prefixes are saved and automatically re-applied when a player joins the server.
* PlaceholderAPI Support: Comes with a ``%paperprefix_prefix%`` placeholder to integrate with other plugins.

**Lightweight**: Designed to be efficient and not impact your server's performance.
